#### **4. Declining Child Sex Ratio ( #CSR ): A National Concern**

- **Definition**: #Child_Sex_Ratio is the number of girls per 1,000 boys in the age group of 0-6 years.
- **Trends**: As per the **2011 Census**, the CSR dropped to **918** from **927** in 2001. States like #Haryana , #Punjab , and #Rajasthan recorded alarming ratios below 850.
- **Causes**:
    - #Patriarchy **mindset**: Preference for male children due to #socio-economic and #cultural factors.
    - **Female** #foeticide : Misuse of diagnostic technologies for #sex_determination .
    - **Economic burden**: #Dowry system and perceived financial liabilities associated with raising girls.

#### **5. Social and Cultural Dimensions**

- **Gender** #stereotypes : Deep-rooted biases against girls in Indian society.
- **Role of media**: Highlighting success stories of women to challenge stereotypes.
- #community_participation : Engaging local leaders, #NGOs , and #self-help_groups ( #SHG ) to drive behavioural change.

#### **6. Economic Implications**

- **Return on investment**: Educating girls has a #multiplier_effect on #GDP growth, #health outcomes, and #poverty reduction.

#### **7. Legal Framework**

- #PCPNDT **Act, 1994**: Prohibits #sex_selection and regulates #prenatal_diagnostic_techniques .

#### **13. Conclusion**

The **Beti Bachao Beti Padhao** scheme is a critical intervention to address gender inequality in India. While BBBP strides in improving gender metrics and awareness, challenges like fund allocation inefficiencies and regional disparities persist. The integration with **Mission Shakti** and renewed focus on community engagement signal a shift toward sustainable, women-led development. Sustained efforts are needed to overcome cultural and structural barriers. A multi-dimensional approach, combining legal, social, economic, and educational interventions, is essential for achieving the vision of a gender-just society.

- **Capacity building**: Training #Healthcare workers, teachers, and community leaders.
- **Research and innovation**: Encouraging studies on gender dynamics and effective interventions.

By addressing the root causes of #gender_inequality and fostering a supportive ecosystem for girls, India can unlock the full potential of its #demographic_dividend and achieve #sustainable_development .
