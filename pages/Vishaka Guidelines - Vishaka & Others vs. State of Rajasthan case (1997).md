The **Vishaka and Others v. State of Rajasthan** case (1997) is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history. Here's a breakdown of its significance in the context of sexual harassment:

- **Background:**
    - Bhanwari Devi, a social worker in #Rajasthan , was gang-raped by upper-caste men for her efforts to prevent a #child_marriage .
    - This horrific incident highlighted the vulnerability of women working in rural areas and the lack of legal protection against #sexual_harassment .
- **Supreme Court Intervention:**
    - A #Public_Interest_Litigation (PIL) was filed by women's rights organizations, including #Vishaka , challenging the lack of adequate legal provisions to address sexual harassment at the workplace.
- **Key Findings & Guidelines:**
    - The Supreme Court recognized that #sexual_harassment at the workplace is a form of discrimination and a violation of women's fundamental rights (Article 14, 15, 19(1)(g), and 21 of the Indian Constitution).
    - The court issued a set of guidelines for employers to prevent and redress sexual harassment at the workplace, which became known as the #Vishaka_Guidelines.
    - These guidelines mandated the establishment of #Internal_Complaints_Committees (ICCs) in all workplaces to investigate and address complaints of sexual harassment.
    - They **defined sexual harassment broadly, encompassing physical, verbal, and psychological forms of harassment**.
    - The guidelines emphasized the responsibility of employers to create a safe and respectful work environment, conduct awareness programs, and take appropriate disciplinary action against offenders.

**Significance of the Vishaka Guidelines:**

- **Landmark Judgment:** The Vishaka judgment set a crucial precedent for addressing sexual harassment in India.
- **Influenced Legislation:** The guidelines significantly influenced the subsequent legislation on sexual harassment, namely the #Sexual_Harassment_of_Women_at_Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 #POSH Act.
- **Enhanced Awareness:** Raised awareness about sexual harassment and its impact on women in the workplace.
- **Empowered Women:** Empowered women to speak out against sexual harassment and seek redressal for their grievances.

**The Vishaka Guidelines remain a significant landmark in the fight against sexual harassment in India, providing a framework for creating safer and more respectful workplaces for women.**

**Note:** This response focuses on the Vishaka case as the most significant landmark judgment in this area. Other important cases, such as those related to the implementation and interpretation of the #POSH Act, have also contributed to the evolving legal framework for addressing sexual harassment in India.
