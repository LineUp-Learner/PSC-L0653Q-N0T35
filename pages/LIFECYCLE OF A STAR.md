The terms "stellar evolution" and "life cycle of a star" are essentially synonymous, describing the sequence of changes a star undergoes throughout its existence, from birth in a molecular cloud to its eventual death or transformation into a stellar remnant. This journey is primarily determined by the star's initial mass.

**1. Birth: From Giant Molecular Clouds (Nebulae)**

- Stars are born within vast clouds of gas (mostly hydrogen and helium) and dust called **molecular clouds** or **nebulae**. These are often referred to as "stellar nurseries."
- **Gravitational Collapse:** Regions within these clouds become dense enough that gravity overcomes the outward pressure from the gas, causing them to collapse. This collapse can be triggered by various events like shockwaves from supernovae or density waves in spiral galaxies.
- **Fragmentation:** As a cloud collapses, it often fragments into smaller, denser cores, each potentially forming one or more stars.
- **Protostar Formation:** Each collapsing fragment heats up as its density increases, forming a **protostar** at the center, surrounded by a rotating disk of gas and dust called a **protoplanetary disk**. The protostar accretes material from this disk.

**2. The Protostar Phase:**

- The protostar continues to grow in mass as it pulls in more material.
- **T-Tauri Stars:** Lower-mass protostars (less than a few solar masses) go through a phase called the **T-Tauri phase**, characterized by strong stellar winds and jets of gas.
- The core temperature and pressure of the protostar increase over time due to gravitational contraction.

**3. Main Sequence Star: Nuclear Fusion Ignition**

- When the core temperature reaches a critical point (around 10 million Kelvin), nuclear fusion ignites. In this process, hydrogen nuclei (protons) fuse to form helium nuclei, releasing tremendous amounts of energy.
- **Hydrostatic Equilibrium:** The outward pressure generated by this nuclear fusion balances the inward force of gravity, creating a stable star known as a **main sequence star**.
- **Lifespan on the Main Sequence:** A star spends the majority of its life on the main sequence, steadily burning hydrogen in its core. The duration of this phase depends strongly on the star's mass:
    - **Massive Stars:** Burn their fuel much faster and have shorter main sequence lifetimes (millions of years).
    - **Low-Mass Stars (like red dwarfs):** Burn their fuel very slowly and have extremely long main sequence lifetimes (tens of billions to trillions of years, much longer than the current age of the universe). Our Sun will spend about 10 billion years on the main sequence.

**4. Post-Main Sequence Evolution: Running Out of Fuel**

- Eventually, the hydrogen fuel in the star's core will be exhausted. What happens next depends critically on the star's initial mass.
    **A. Low- to Medium-Mass Stars (roughly < 8 solar masses, including our Sun):**
    - **Red Giant Phase:** With no hydrogen fusion in the core, gravity causes the core to contract and heat up. A shell of hydrogen surrounding the core starts to fuse, causing the outer layers of the star to expand and cool, turning it into a **red giant**. The star becomes much larger and more luminous but has a cooler surface temperature.
    - **Helium Fusion:** If the core becomes hot and dense enough, helium fusion ignites in the core, fusing helium into carbon and oxygen. This can occur gradually in more massive low- to medium-mass stars or through a brief, intense event called the **helium flash** in lower-mass stars.
    - **Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB):** After helium is exhausted in the core, fusion occurs in shells around the carbon-oxygen core (helium shell burning and hydrogen shell burning). The star expands again, becoming an **asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star**, characterized by instability and mass loss through stellar winds.
    - **Planetary Nebula:** The outer layers of the AGB star are expelled into space, forming a glowing shell of gas and dust called a **planetary nebula**. The term "planetary" is a historical misnomer, as it has nothing to do with planets.
    - **White Dwarf:** The remaining core, now composed mostly of carbon and oxygen, cools and contracts to become a dense **white dwarf**. A white dwarf no longer undergoes nuclear fusion and slowly fades away over trillions of years.
    - **Black Dwarf (Theoretical):** Eventually, a white dwarf will cool down to the point where it no longer emits significant heat or light, becoming a **black dwarf**. However, the universe is not yet old enough for any black dwarfs to have formed.
        **B. High-Mass Stars (roughly > 8 solar masses):**
    - **Red Supergiant:** After the main sequence, high-mass stars evolve into **red supergiants**. They undergo a series of fusion stages in their core, fusing heavier and heavier elements (helium to carbon, then oxygen, neon, silicon, and finally iron). Each stage is shorter than the last.
    - **Core Collapse Supernova:** Iron is the end of the line for fusion in stellar cores because fusing iron does not release energy; it requires energy input. When the iron core forms, it can no longer support itself against gravity and collapses catastrophically in a fraction of a second.
    - **Supernova Explosion:** The imploding core bounces back due to nuclear forces, generating a powerful shockwave that blasts the outer layers of the star into space in a spectacular explosion called a **supernova**. Supernovae are incredibly luminous events and play a crucial role in the distribution of heavy elements throughout the universe.
    - **Stellar Remnants:** What remains after a supernova depends on the mass of the original star's core:
        - **Neutron Star:** If the core mass is between about 1.4 and 3 solar masses, the collapse continues until protons and electrons are forced to combine to form neutrons, resulting in an extremely dense object called a **neutron star**. Neutron stars are typically only about 20 kilometers in diameter but have immense densities and strong magnetic fields (pulsars are rotating neutron stars with beams of radiation).
        - **Black Hole:** If the core mass is greater than about 3 solar masses, the gravitational collapse is so overwhelming that nothing can stop it, and the core collapses to form a **black hole**, a region of spacetime with gravity so strong that not even light can escape.

**Key Factors Determining Stellar Evolution:**

- **Initial Mass:** This is the most crucial factor. It dictates the star's temperature, luminosity, lifespan, and ultimate fate.
- **Chemical Composition:** The initial abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium (metallicity) can also influence a star's evolution.
