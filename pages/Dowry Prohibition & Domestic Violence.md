**Dowry Prohibition & Domestic Violence Abolition in India: A Comprehensive Analysis**

**1. Historical and Legal Foundations**

- **1.1 Colonial Era Influences:**
    - Dowry, initially a _stridhan_ (women's wealth), became a coercive practice under British land revenue systems.
    - This system marginalised women's property rights.

        - Defines dowry as **any property or valuable security** given or agreed to be given in connection with a marriage.
        - Penalties include **imprisonment up to five years** for giving or taking dowry.
        - Demanding dowry is also punishable with imprisonment.
        - Advertisements offering dowry are banned.
        - Agreements for dowry are void.
        - Dowry received by anyone other than the wife should be transferred to her.

        - Supreme Court (SC) guidelines (2017) require family welfare committees to curb misuse.
    - **Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:** Civil law offering protection orders, residence rights, and monetary relief.
        - Defines domestic violence broadly, including **physical, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse**.
        - Includes **deprivation of livelihood or property** as economic abuse.
    - **Criminal Law Amendment (2013):** Included acid attacks and stalking under IPC, indirectly strengthening DV frameworks.
- **1.3 Other Relevant Laws:**
    - **Section 304B IPC:** Defines "dowry death" with a **punishment of imprisonment for seven years at the least**.

**2. Socio-Cultural Dynamics**

- **2.1 Persistent Practices:**
    - Dowry is entrenched due to **patriarchal norms, caste dynamics, and status aspirations**.
    - It's often disguised as "gifts," perpetuating the commodification of women.
    - Dowry demands can escalate in hypergamous marriages, such as among **Jats in Haryana (₹50-70 lakh)**.
- **2.2 Underreporting of Domestic Violence:**
    - NFHS-5 (2019-21) indicates **30% of women face domestic violence, but only 14% seek help**.
    - **Stigma, financial dependence, and normalisation of abuse** hinder reporting.
- **2.3 Urban-Rural Divide:**
    - NFHS-5 data shows **32% of urban women and 29% of rural women** report domestic violence.
    - **Urban anonymity may aid reporting, while rural collectivism suppresses it**.

    - Economic abuse under PWDVA includes **deprivation of resources**.
- **3.2 Macroeconomic Factors:**
    - Women’s unpaid labour devalues their economic contribution.
    - Unpaid care work is valued at **₹22.7 lakh crore annually**.
    - Farmer suicides in Maharashtra (**14,000+ since 2018**) are linked to dowry-driven debt cycles.
