## Introduction

#Electoral_systems are methodologies used to translate votes cast by citizens into seats won by parties and candidates. The choice of electoral system can fundamentally determine how a country's parliament is constituted and how its government is formed. Different systems can produce radically different outcomes from the same set of votes.

# 1. #Majoritarian_Electoral_Systems

### #First_Past_the_Post ( #FPTP ) / #Simple_Majority_System

**Definition:** A system where the candidate who receives the most votes in a constituency wins the seat, regardless of whether they secure an #absolute_majority (achieving 50%+ of total votes cast).

**Process:**

- **Each voter casts a single vote** for a candidate
- The candidate with the highest number of votes wins
- No requirement to achieve 50%+ of votes

**Application in India:**

- #Lok_Sabha elections
- #State_Legislative_Assemblies elections
- #Single-member_constituencies - only one individual wins the election & represents the entire constituency.

**Advantages:**

- Simple to understand & implement
- Direct constituency representation
- **Stable governments**
- **Clear accountability b/w representatives & voters**

**Disadvantages:**

- **Disproportionate representation**
- Smaller parties often **underrepresented**
- Can result in #wasted_votes when many voters support losing candidates
- May encourage **tactical voting over sincere preference**

**Global Examples:** #UK , #US , #Canada , #India

**Analogy:** Think of #FPTP as ==<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a race where the first person to cross the finish line wins, regardless of how close others may be behind them.</span>==

### #Two-Round_System ( #TRS ) / #Run-off_Voting

**Definition:** An electoral system where a **second round of voting is held if no candidate achieves a specified threshold (usually an absolute majority) in the first round**.

**Process:**

- First round: All candidates participate
- If a candidate secures absolute majority (50%+1), they win
- If no candidate secures majority, a second round is held
- In the second round, typically only the top two candidates participate
- The candidate with most votes in the second round wins

**Application in India:** Not used for general elections but **used in some organizational elections**

**Global Examples:** #France , #Brazil , #Iran

**Analogy:** Like ==<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a knockout tournament where participants get a second chance if no clear winner emerges in the first attempt.</span>==

### #Alternative_Vote (AV) / #Instant_Runoff_Voting ( #IRV )

**Definition:** A preferential voting system where **voters rank candidates in order of preference, eliminating the need for a separate runoff election.**

**Process:**

- Voters rank candidates (1st, 2nd, 3rd choice, etc.)
- If a candidate receives 50%+1 of first preferences, they win
- If no majority, the candidate with fewest first preferences is eliminated
- Votes for eliminated candidate are redistributed according to second preferences
- Process continues until one candidate achieves majority

**Application in India:** Not used for general elections

**Global Examples:** #Australia (House of Representatives), #Ireland (Presidential elections)

**Analogy:** ==<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Like having multiple rounds of voting happening all at once, with your vote automatically transferring to your next choice if your preferred candidate is eliminated.</span>==

## 2. #Proportional_Representation ( #PR ) Systems

### #List_Proportional_Representation

**Definition:** A system where parties present lists of candidates and receive seats in **proportion to their share of the total vote**.

**Types:**

1. **Closed List PR:**
    - Voters **vote for parties, not candidates**
    - Parties determine the order of candidates on their list
    - Seats are allocated to candidates in the order they appear on the list
2. **Open List PR:**
    - Voters can influence which candidates from a party list get elected
    - **Voters vote for both a party and indicate preference for specific candidates**
    - Candidates with most preference votes get elected first from their party's allocation

**Process:**

- #Electoral_quotas or divisors are used to allocate seats
- Common formulas include:
    - **Hare Quota:** Total valid votes ÷ Total seats
    - **Droop Quota:** (Total valid votes ÷ (Total seats + 1)) + 1
    - **D'Hondt Method:** Sequential division of party vote totals by 1, 2, 3, etc.

**Application in India:**

- Not used for general parliamentary elections
- No direct usage. Only used in combination with STV in Rajya Sabha, President & Vice President elections.

**Global Examples:**

- Closed List: #Spain , #South_Africa , #Portugal
- Open List: #Brazil , #Finland , #Italy

**Advantages:**

- High degree of proportionality between votes and seats
- **Better representation of minority parties**
- **Reduced "wasted votes"**
- Higher #voter_turnout

**Disadvantages:**

- May lead to #coalition governments and potential #political_instability
- Weaker #geographic_representation
- In closed lists, **reduced voter choice** for specific candidates
- Can **give small parties disproportionate power in coalition negotiations**

**Analogy:** ==<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Think of PR as dividing a pie proportionally according to how many people voted for each party – if a party gets 30% of votes, they get roughly 30% of seats.</span>==

### #Mixed_Member_Proportional ( #MMP )

**Definition:** A **hybrid system combining FPTP and List PR elements to balance constituency representation with proportionality.** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This can be applied in India. Balanced & Highly beneficial</span>

**Process:**

- Voters typically cast two votes:
    1. Constituency vote (FPTP)
    2. Party list vote (PR)
- Constituency seats are filled using FPTP
- Additional **"compensatory" seats are allocated from party lists to correct disproportionality**

**Application in India:** Not currently used

**Global Examples:** #Germany , #New_Zealand , #Scotland

**Analogy:** ==<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Like having two elections in one – one for local representatives and one to ensure the overall result fairly reflects how people voted for parties.</span>==

### #Single_Transferable_Vote ( #STV ) #PR-STV 

**Definition:** A preferential voting system **used in multi-member constituencies that aims to minimize wasted votes and ensure proportional representation.** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Better system than MMP, but very complex to implement in our country due to the complexity of the process & population of the country.</span>

**Process:**

- Used in #multi-member_constituencies
- Voters rank candidates in order of preference
- A quota is established for election (typically Droop quota)
- Candidates who reach the #quota are elected
- Surplus votes of elected candidates are transferred to next preferences
- If no candidate reaches quota, the candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their votes redistributed
- Process continues until all seats are filled

**Application in India:**

- ==<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rajya Sabha elections</span>== (indirect election by state legislators)
- ==<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">President and Vice President elections</span>== (indirect)
- Used in some state legislative council elections

**Global Examples:** #Ireland (parliamentary elections), #Malta , Australian Senate

**Advantages:**

- **High degree of voter choice**
- **Reduces wasted votes**
- Proportional representation without requiring party lists. ==<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Better alternative for List Proportional Representation</span>==
- Encourages candidates to seek transfers from other candidates (**promoting civility**)
- **Dilution of any majority beyond absolute majority** (prevents concentration of votes)

**Disadvantages:**

- **Complex & Time-consuming** counting process
- May be **difficult for voters to understand**
- Does not guarantee perfect proportionality

**Analogy:** ==<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Like a musical chairs game where your support can transfer to another candidate if your first choice already has enough votes to win or has no chance of winning.</span>==

## 3. **Other Least common Systems**

### Limited Vote

**Definition:** A semi-proportional system used in multi-member districts where voters have fewer votes than there are seats to be filled.

**Process:**

- Voters have multiple but limited votes (fewer than seats available)
- Candidates with the highest vote totals win

**Application in India:** Not used for general elections
**Global Examples:** Spain (Senate elections)

### Cumulative Vote

**Definition:** A system where voters have multiple votes equal to the number of seats and can distribute them as they wish among candidates.

**Process:**

- Voters can allocate multiple votes to single candidates
- Allows minority groups to concentrate votes on specific candidates

**Application in India:** Not used for general elections, but used in some corporate board elections
**Global Examples:** Used in some local elections in the US

### Borda Count

**Definition:** A preferential voting system where candidates receive points based on their position in voters' rankings.

**Process:**

- Voters rank candidates
- Points are assigned based on rankings (e.g., in a 5-candidate race: 4 points for 1st, 3 for 2nd, etc.)
- Candidate with the most points wins

**Application in India:** Not used for general elections
**Global Examples:** Nauru, Slovenia (partial use)

## 4. **Electoral Systems in India**

### #Lok_Sabha and #State_Legislative_Assemblies

- **System Used:** First Past the Post
- **Key Features:**
    - Single-member constituencies
    - Candidate with highest votes wins
    - Simple plurality required (not absolute majority)
- **Impact:** Has generally provided stable governments but sometimes results in parties winning majority of seats with minority of total votes

### #Rajya_Sabha

- **System Used:** #Single_Transferable_Vote
- **Key Features:**
    - Indirect election by members of State Legislative Assemblies
    - Preferential voting where MLAs rank candidates
    - Proportional representation of parties in state legislatures reflected in Rajya Sabha
- **Process Detail:**
    - Each MLA's vote has a value based on state #population
    - Calculation: (Total population of state ÷ Total #MLA ) ÷ 1000
    - Quota for election: (Total value of votes ÷ (Seats + 1)) + 1

### Presidential and Vice- #Presidential_Elections

- **System Used:** Modified form of #Single_Transferable_Vote
- **Key Features:**
    - Indirect election by an electoral college
    - Electoral college comprises MPs and MLAs
    - Value of MP votes is **uniform**
    - Value of MLA votes varies by state population
- **Process Detail:**
    - Value of MP vote = Total value of all MLA votes ÷ Total MPs
    - Value of MLA vote = (State population ÷ (1000 × Number of MLAs))
    - Quota for election: 50% of valid votes + 1

## 5. Electoral System Reforms and Debates in India

### Proposed Reforms

1. **Proportional Representation:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(Mixed Member Proportional is the best choice in all the PRs)</span>
    - Law Commission of India (170th Report, 1999) recommended partial PR
    - Suggested 25% of Lok Sabha seats be filled through PR
    - Aim to improve representation of smaller parties and minorities
2. **Mixed System:** ==<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(This system have to be implemented)</span>==
    - Various committees have suggested #Mixed_Member_Proportional system
    - Balance between constituency representation and proportionality
    - Could address underrepresentation issues while maintaining local representation
3. **Runoff/Alternative Voting:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(This system is good, but not with dilution of vote concentration beyond absolute majority & failure to solve underrepresentation)</span>
    - Suggestions for two-round system to ensure elected representatives have majority support
    - Would eliminate candidates winning with small percentage of votes

### Key Debates

4. **Representation vs. Stability:**
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">FPTP provides stable governments but potentially unrepresentative outcomes</span>
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PR provides better representation but might lead to coalition instability</span>
5. **Women's Representation:**
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PR with mandated gender quotas on party lists could increase women's representation</span>
    - Currently low #female_representation in Lok Sabha (approximately 14% after 2019 elections)
6. **Regional and Minority Representation:**
    - Current system may **underrepresent geographically dispersed minorities**
    - PR systems could potentially improve this representation

## 6. Comparative Analysis of Electoral Systems

### Selection Criteria for Electoral Systems

1. **Representativeness:** How accurately the elected body reflects voter preferences
2. **Accountability:** Clear lines of responsibility between representatives and voters
3. **Government Formation:** Ability to produce stable, effective governments
4. **Political Party Development:** Impact on party system and political landscape
5. **Simplicity:** Ease of understanding for voters and administrators

### Performance Comparison

| System  | Representativeness | Accountability | Stability     | Simplicity | Minority Representation |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| FPTP    | Low to Medium      | High           | High          | Very High  | Low                     |
| TRS     | Medium             | High           | High          | Medium     | Low to Medium           |

| STV     | High               | Medium to High | Medium        | Low        | Medium to High          |

## 7. Constitutional and Legal Framework for Elections in India

### Constitutional Provisions

- **Article 324-329:** Establishes Election Commission and outlines election framework
- #Article_81 : Composition of the House of the People (Lok Sabha)
- #Article_80 : Composition of the Council of States (Rajya Sabha)
- #Article_170 : Composition of Legislative Assemblies
- #Article_171 : Composition of Legislative Councils

### Statutory Framework

- #Representation_of_the_People_Act, 1950: Provides for allocation of seats and preparation of electoral rolls
- #Representation_of_the_People_Act, 1951: Regulates conduct of elections
- #Delimitation_Act : Provides for readjustment of constituencies #Delimitation

## Conclusion

The choice of electoral system is not merely a technical decision but a fundamental political choice that shapes a country's governance, party system, and political culture. While India has largely maintained the FPTP system inherited from the British colonial period, ongoing debates about electoral reform reflect evolving understandings of representation and democracy. The ideal electoral system varies based on a nation's specific historical, social, and political context, with each system presenting distinct trade-offs between representativeness, accountability, stability, and simplicity.

For UPSC aspirants, understanding these systems and their implications is crucial for analyzing governance structures, electoral politics, and potential reforms in India and globally.
