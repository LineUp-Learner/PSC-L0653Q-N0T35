- **People live as Individuals. Individuals form #Families . Families co-ordinate to become a #Community . Large no of #Community forms #Society . #Society leads to Disagreement & Disorder. Disagreement & Disorder cause Dissonance. #Rules & #Regulations are framed to eliminate Dissonance, and to maintain Order & Harmony in the #Society . Decisions are made for the #Welfare of the #Society . #Welfae is achieved and maintained by ensuring the #Rules are formulated & followed properly, and right decisions are made. A #Government does this job.**

## #Government

```
A system or a group of individuals possessing a legitimate authority within a defined territory responsible for making decisions, formulating, changing and enforcing laws, managing public resources, and ensuring the rights, safety and well-being of its citizens, and for the welfare of the territory and society it belongs to or formed from.

Effective governance requires accountability, adaptability, and a commitment to justice, equality, and the common good.
```

## #Organs_of_Government

![[Organs_of_Government.png]]
#Separation_of_Powers - **The three organs of the government should always be kept separate, though they interact with each other & work together, to check and balance the government if any of the organ works beyond its rules and roles.**

#Legislature - For making laws - Members of Assemblies, Elected by People - MP, MLA, Councillors etc.  
#Executive - PM, CM, Ministers, IAS, IPS, IFS etc.  
#Judiciary - CJI, Supreme Court, High Court, Sub-Ordinate Courts

**NOTE : Though #President and #Governor are nominal #head_of_nation & #head_of_state respectively, #Prime_Minister and #Chief_Minister are the actual #head_of_executives of #nation & #state respectively.**

**The #President and #Governor don't interfere in the working of #nation & #state governments normally. But, they have special powers under special circumstances, which will be discussed in #Powers_of_President and #Powers_of_Governor .**

# **Organs and Levels of Government in India**

- **Democratic Republic & Federal Structure:**
    - The preamble declares India as a “sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic”
    - “Union of States” is enshrined in Article 1, yet the system is described as quasi‑federal because while powers are divided among Union, State, and Local levels, the central government retains overriding authority (especially in emergencies) [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India)
- **Separation of Powers with Checks and Balances:**  
     • Though the Constitution does not explicitly mention “separation of powers,” it assigns distinct roles to the Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary.  
     • Overlapping functions exist (e.g., the President’s role in both the executive and legislative process via ordinance-making), but mutual checks (judicial review, no-confidence motions, and constitutional amendments) ensure accountability [byjus.com](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/separation-power-indian-constitution/)
- **Amendment Process and Basic Structure Doctrine:**  
     • The Constitution is amendable, but landmark judgments (e.g., Kesavananda Bharati, 1973) have established that its “basic structure” cannot be altered, preserving fundamental institutional features [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India)

## **1. ORGANS OF GOVERNMENT**

India’s governance structure follows the **doctrine of separation of powers** enshrined in the Constitution, with three primary organs:

### **A. Legislature**

<span style="background:#d2cbff">UPSC Relevance: Key for GS Paper II (Governance) and Essay.</span>

- **Function**: Law-making, oversight, and representation.
- **Union Level**:
    - **Parliament (Article 79)**: Bicameral—**Lok Sabha** (Lower House, directly elected) and **Rajya Sabha** (Upper House, represents states).
    - **Key Roles**: Enacting laws, approving budgets, no-confidence motions, and constitutional amendments.
- **State Level**:
    - **State Legislature (Article 179)**: Unicameral (e.g., Tamil Nadu) or bicameral (e.g., Bihar with **Vidhan Sabha** and **Vidhan Parishad**).
        - **Controversy**: Tamil Nadu abolished its Legislative Council in 1986, citing inefficiency; **Bihar** retained Bicameralism.
    - **Powers**: State List (Article 246), law-making on subjects like police, public health.
        - Kerala’s **Local Self-Government Act, 1994** devolved powers to Panchayats.
- **Local Level**:
    - **Panchayats** (73rd Amendment): **33% reservation** for women (over 50% in states like Bihar and Maharashtra).
    - **Municipalities** (74th Amendment): **Smart Cities Mission (2015)** empowers urban local bodies. **Pune’s participatory budgeting** model.
    - Grassroots law-making on local issues (sanitation, water supply).

#### A.1. **_Legislative Functioning & Examples:_**

- **Types of Bills**: Ordinary (simple majority), Money (Article 110), Constitutional (special majority + state ratification for some).
- **Committee System**: Departmentally Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) for scrutiny (e.g., 2019 Surrogacy Bill revised after committee inputs).
- **Critical Concepts**:
    - **Anti-Defection Law** (10th Schedule): Role in maintaining party discipline (e.g., 2022 Maharashtra crisis).
    - **Speaker’s Discretion**: Certification of Money Bills (controversy in **Aadhaar Act, 2016**).
- **Recent Developments**:
    - **Women’s Reservation Bill, 2023 (Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam)**: Constitutional amendment for 33% seats in legislatures (pending ratification/delimitation).
