#Kamal_Parmar , a fabrication factory owner in #Ahmedabad , #Gujarat , initiated the #footpath_school over 15 years ago in 2009 to provide free evening tuition and meals to underprivileged children from nearby slums. Concerned by the poor quality of education in municipal schools and high #drop-out rates, he began teaching basic literacy and numeracy skills to these children, many of whom struggled with reading and writing despite being enrolled in school. Operating on the footpath near his Auto-fabrication workshop in the Bhudarpura area, Parmar's initiative has grown to #educate over 100 children daily. Many local school teachers, #youth , former students, people from locality and #NGO have voluntarily enrolled in assisting the initiative. Parmar emphasizes the importance of subjects like Mathematics and English, personally teaching primary students and arranging special English classes for older students. Recognizing that hunger can impede learning, he also provides #free_meals to the children every evening, offering dishes like Pav-Bhaji, Chana Puri, and Idli-Sambhar. Beyond academics, Parmar instills #ethical values, #hygiene practices, and #environmental awareness in his students. His efforts have led to significant achievements, with many former students pursuing higher #education and securing professional roles, including positions as engineers and bank managers. Parmar's dedication has garnered media attention and recognition, including the "Dharati Ratna" award from Ashirvaad Education Trust in 2009. His story has been featured in publications like the "Times of India" and "Reader's Digest." However, in 2020, the "Footpath School" faced challenges due to the #COVID-19 pandemic, leading to its closure. Despite these setbacks, Parmar remained hopeful about resuming his educational endeavours once conditions improved. The "Footpath School" stands as a testament to how individual initiative can make a profound impact on #community #education and #empowerment .
