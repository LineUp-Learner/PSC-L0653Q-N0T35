## 1. Definition and Conceptual Framework

**Definition**:  
Parliamentary Committees are specialized groups of #Member_of_Parliament #MP , appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker (Lok Sabha) or Chairman (Rajya Sabha), tasked with examining specific matters— #legislation , #budgets , or oversight—and reporting their findings to #Parliament . They operate under the direction of the presiding officers, with secretariats provided by the #Lok_Sabha or #Rajya_Sabha.

**Conceptual Clarity**:

- **Mini-Parliaments**: They mirror the broader Parliament, enabling detailed scrutiny beyond the plenary’s capacity. #Mini-Parliaments
- **Eyes and Ears**: They serve as Parliament’s sensory organs, detecting issues and refining legislative inputs.
- **Filters**: Analogous to water purifiers, they refine policies and bills by removing flaws before final enactment.
- **Bridge Builders**: They connect the #Legislature , #Executive , and citizens , fostering inclusive governance .

**Constitutional Basis**:  
While **_not explicitly detailed_** in the #constitution , their authority stems from:

- **Article 105**: Grants #parliamentary_privileges , enabling committee powers.
- **Article 118**: Empowers each House to frame rules for its proceedings, under which committees operate.
- #Rules_of_Procedure : Lok_Sabha (Rules 253–331 Q) and Rajya_Sabha (Rules 268–278) provide the #operational_framework #frameworks .

**Significance**:  
They address the Parliament’s limitations—its unwieldy size, time constraints, and lack of expertise—ensuring thorough deliberation on complex issues.

## 2. Classification and Types

Parliamentary Committees are broadly classified into two categories based on **_permanence and purpose_**:

### 2.1 Standing Committees

Permanent bodies reconstituted annually or periodically, they operate continuously and include:

#### A. Financial Committees #Financial_Committees

- **Public Accounts Committee (PAC)**: #Public_Accounts_Committee #PAC

    - **Composition**: 22 members (15 Lok Sabha, 7 Rajya Sabha), elected annually via #Proportional*Representation with #Single_Transferable_Vote ( #PR-STV ) - \_Note: This same mechanism is used for selecting the nominated* #Rajya_Sabha #MP
    - **Chairperson**: Appointed by the #Speaker, traditionally from the opposition (not from the opposition party, but from the opposition entirely) since 1967 (e.g., Murli Manohar Joshi in 2011).
    - **Functions**: Examines #CAG #audits reports (appropriation, finance, public undertakings) to ensure fiscal propriety, legality, and efficiency. _This committee can prescribe inquiry on higher level executives & authorities in any ministry/department to the parliament, if found to be performing illegal acts, parliament which in turn may order initiation of investigation by investigation agencies._
    - **Historical Context**: Established in 1921 under the #Government_of_India_Act , 1919, ==it’s the oldest committee.==
    - **Example**: PAC’s 2011 report on the **2G spectrum scam** exposed a **₹1.76 lakh crore loss**, triggering #policy_reforms #reforms .
    - **Limitations**: Post-mortem focus, advisory nature, no policy intervention.

- **Estimates Committee**: #Estimates_Committee #continuous_economy_committee

    - **Composition**: 30 members (all Lok Sabha), elected annually via #PR-STV .
    - **Chairperson**: Appointed by the Speaker, typically from the #ruling_party .
    - **Functions**: Reviews budget estimates post-voting, suggests economies, and alternative policies.
    - **Historical Context**: Formed in 1950, dubbed the ==“**continuous economy committee**.”==
    - **Example**: Its 2018 report on NPAs in banking recommended systemic [#credit_appraisal](https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=419&q=credit+appraisal&gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgYIABBFGDkyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQABhAMgYIAhAAGEAyBggDEAAYQDIGCAQQABhAMgYIBRAAGEAyBggGEAAYQDIGCAcQABhAMgYICBAAGEDSAQg0NzU5ajBqMagCALACAA&PC=W099) reforms.
    - **Limitations**: Post-voting scrutiny (post-election audit), lacks CAG expertise, selective ministry coverage.

- **Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU)**: #Committee_on_Public_Undertakings #COPU
    - **Composition**: 22 members (15 Lok Sabha, 7 Rajya Sabha), elected annually via PR-STV.
    - **Chairperson**: Appointed by the Speaker from Lok Sabha members.
    - **Functions**: Examines #PSU reports, CAG audits, and operational efficiency. #Public_Sector_Undertakings
    - **Historical Context**: Created in 1964 on Krishna Menon Committee’s recommendation.
    - **Example**: COPU’s review of #ONGC ’s performance influenced PSU autonomy policies. COPU also review #CAG audits & calls the authorities of each PSU for reasoning & oral evidence whenever necessary.
    - **Limitations**: Limited annual coverage (10–12 PSUs), non-technical focus.

#### B. #Departmentally_Related_Standing_Committees #DRSC

- **Number**: 24, covering all ministries/departments (16 under Lok Sabha, 8 under Rajya Sabha).
- **Composition**: 31 members each (21 Lok Sabha, 10 Rajya Sabha), nominated by Speaker/Chairman.
- **Functions**: Scrutinize demands for grants, bills, #annual_reports , and long-term policies.
- **Historical Context**: Established in 1993 (17 committees), expanded to 24 in 2004.
- **Jurisdiction**: Examples include Committee on #Defense , #Finance , #Agriculture (see Table 1).
- **Example**: The #Standing_Committee on #Finance shaped the #GST framework (2017) through stakeholder inputs.
- **Limitations**: Advisory role, no day-to-day administrative oversight.

---

## 3. Functioning and Processes

- **Appointment**: Members elected via #PR-STV or nominated, reflecting party strength. Ministers are ineligible for key committees (e.g., Financial, DRSCs).
- **Tenure**: One year for Standing Committees; Ad Hoc Committees last until their task is complete.
- **Chairpersonship**: Appointed by Speaker/Chairman; opposition chairs PAC by convention.
- **Meetings**: In-camera, with flexibility in procedure compared to plenary sessions (முழுமையான அமர்வு)
- **Evidence Collection**: Can summon witnesses, demand documents, and consult experts.
- **Decision-Making**: Consensus-driven; voting rare, dissent notes permitted.
- **Reporting**: Reports submitted to Parliament, with government responses typically due within three months.
- **Limitations**: Advisory nature, no executive powers, post-mortem focus in financial scrutiny.

**Example**: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The Standing Committee on Agriculture’s 2019 report on</span> #Agrarian_distress <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">influenced</span> #farm_policy <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">debates, though its recommendations were advisory.</span>

## 4. Significance in Indian Democracy

1. **Deliberative Democracy**: Facilitate detailed, non-partisan discussions, enhancing legislative quality.
2. **Executive Accountability**: Serve as #checks-and-balances on the #executive , e.g., #PAC ’s audit scrutiny.
3. **Workload Management**: Handle voluminous tasks, allowing Parliament to focus on broader issues.
4. **Technical Expertise**: Enable specialized scrutiny (e.g., #GST Bill refinements).
5. **Consensus Building**: Foster #bipartisanship , crucial in India’s #coalition politics.
6. **Citizen Engagement**: Incorporate public inputs, strengthening participatory governance.
7. **Federal Balance**: #Rajya_Sabha representation ensures state voices in oversight.

**Evidence**: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Only 25% of bills in the 16 th Lok Sabha (2014–19) were referred to committees, compared to 71% in the 15 th (2009–14), highlighting their declining yet critical role (PRS Legislative Research).</span>

## 5. Historical Evolution

- **Colonial Era (Pre-1947)**: #PAC established in 1921 under British rule.
- **Early Independence (1947–60)**: #Estimates_Committee (1950) marked the #post-independence start.
- **Expansion (1960–90)**: #COPU formed in 1964, broadening financial oversight.
- **Reform Phase (1993)**: 17 #DRSCs introduced, inspired by G.V. Mavalankar’s vision.
- **Modern Era (2000–Present)**: Expanded to 24 DRSCs in 2004, with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">digital and public engagement</span> focus.

**Milestone**: The 1993 DRSC reform, launched by Vice-President K.R. Narayanan, aimed to enhance executive accountability.

## 6. Challenges and Limitations

8. **Advisory Nature**: Recommendations lack enforceability (e.g., ignored farm law suggestions in 2020). #law_enforcement
9. **Politicization**: Partisan agendas can skew deliberations
    - (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">JPC on 2G split along party lines</span> - Members from the ruling coalition and the opposition parties had fundamentally different interpretations of the evidence and the roles of key individuals. Opposition members accused the ruling coalition of attempting to whitewash the scandal and protect key figures. The JPC's split along party lines contributed to the highly politicized nature of the 2G scandal. The partisan nature of the JPC's work **undermined public trust** in the committee's findings)
10. **Resource Constraints**: Limited research staff and technical expertise hinder depth (_unlike U.S. Congressional committees_).
11. **Time Limitations**: MPs on multiple committees dilute focus; DRSCs meet sporadically (occasionally) (30% monthly in 2019).
12. **Declining Referrals**: **_Bypassing committees_** (e.g., #CAA 2019) undermines scrutiny.
13. **Confidentiality**: In-camera proceedings <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">limit transparency</span>.
14. **Implementation Gap**: Weak follow-up mechanisms reduce impact.

**Critical Insight**: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The executive’s dominance in India’s parliamentary system often overshadows committee influence, necessitating reforms.</span> **IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT THE POLITICAL REFORMS THEMSELVES NEEDS APPROVAL FROM THE PARLIAMENT, WHICH IN TURN FOLLOWS THE RULING PARTY'S MEMBERS, WHO TYPICALLY FOLLOW THE SELECTED EXECUTIVES & BIASED TOWARDS THE CABINET.** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This hinders the governance & political system, making it resistant to accountability in many cases & circumstances</span>

---

## 7. Recent Reforms and Innovations

15. **Digital Integration**: Virtual meetings during #COVID-19 (2020) enhanced accessibility.
16. **Public Engagement**: Increased stakeholder consultations (e.g., #Data_Protection_Bill , 2019).
17. **Capacity Building**: Training for MPs and staff (e.g., Lok Sabha initiatives).
18. **Outcome Monitoring**: Tracking recommendation implementation (e.g., #Action_Taken_Reports - #ATR ).
19. **Inter-Committee Coordination**: Reducing overlap (e.g., joint reviews on cross-cutting issues).

**Example**: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The Health Committee’s virtual hearings on COVID-19 response showcased adaptability.</span>

## 8. Global Comparisons

| **Country**   | **Committee Powers**             | **Public Access** | **Key Feature**                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **India**     | Advisory, limited summoning      | Limited           | Bipartisan, advisory focus       |
| **UK**        | Recommendatory, strong summoning | Extensive         | Select Committees lead inquiries |
| **USA**       | Legislative, subpoena powers     | Extensive         | Directly shape laws              |
| **Germany**   | Consensus-focused                | Moderate          | Mirrors federal ministries       |
| **Australia** | Recommendatory, public hearings  | Extensive         | Senate Estimates scrutiny        |

<span style="background:rgba(240, 107, 5, 0.2)">Lessons for India: Enhancing autonomy, public hearings, and research support could elevate committee impact.</span>

## 9. Landmark Reports and Case Studies

20. **PAC (CAG) on 2G Spectrum (2011)**:

    - Exposed **₹1.76 lakh crore loss**, influencing telecom policy reforms.
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Highlighted partisan divides, limiting effectiveness and loss of public trust.</span>.

21. **Standing Committee on Finance on GST (2017)**:

    - Stakeholder inputs refined the #GST structure, showcasing technical scrutiny. (The committee actively engaged with a wide range of stakeholders, including businesses, industry associations, and experts. This involved conducting hearings, receiving written submissions, and holding consultations.)

22. **JPC on Bofors (1987)**:

    - Investigated defense procurement but faced credibility issues due to political bias. (The #Bofors scandal involved allegations of kickbacks and corruption in the Indian government's procurement of 155mm howitzer guns from the Swedish company Bofors. The committee's composition and its conduct of the investigation raised concerns about its impartiality. It became highly politicized, with both the ruling party and the opposition using it to attack each other. This political polarization further eroded public trust in the #JPC 's findings.)

23. **DRSC on Agriculture (2019)**:
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Warned of agrarian distress, predicting farmer protests (2020–21), but was not considered & evaluated by the government.</span>

**Insight**: Committees excel in technical analysis but falter under political pressure.

## 10. Reform Proposals

24. **Mandatory Bill Referral**: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ensure all bills undergo committee scrutiny (NCRWC, 2002).</span>
25. **Binding Recommendations**: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Partial enforceability for key suggestions.</span>
26. **Enhanced Resources**: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dedicated research units (e.g., U.S. Congressional Research Service model).</span>
27. **Public Transparency**: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Live-stream select proceedings, balancing confidentiality and transparency.</span>.
28. **Expert Inclusion**: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Permanent technical advisors (e.g., RBI economists for Finance Committee)</span>.
29. **Performance Metrics**: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Evaluate committee effectiveness annually.</span>

**Evaluative Note**: Balancing scrutiny with legislative speed is critical—mandatory referrals could delay urgent laws, but bypassing committees risks poor governance.

---

## 11. Future Outlook

- **Short-Term (1–5 Years)**: **_Digital transformation_**, increased public engagement.
- **Medium-Term (5–10 Years)**: Structural reforms, possible constitutional recognition. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ONLY THE CONSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION OF PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES MAY GIVE THEM THEIR FREEDOM AND PROTECTION FROM THE OVERRULING AND MISUSE BY THE EXECUTIVES</span>
- **Long-Term (10+ Years)**: Empowered committees with stronger powers, setting a global benchmark.

**Vision**: As India aims for global leadership, committees could model participatory, transparent governance, aligning with SDG 16 (peace, justice, strong institutions).
