## 0. Context Building & Prerequisites

Parliamentary committees are microcosms of Parliament that function as specialized bodies examining various matters in detail. Understanding these committees requires prerequisite knowledge of:

- **Parliamentary Structure**: Bicameral nature of Indian Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha)
- **Parliamentary Democracy**: Fusion of legislative and executive powers in Westminster model
- **Constitutional Provisions**: Articles 105, 118, and 315-323 dealing with parliamentary privileges, rules of procedure, and statutory bodies
- **Rules of Procedure**: Rules under which committees operate, particularly Rules 253-286 of Lok Sabha and Rules 268-278 of Rajya Sabha
- **Distribution of Powers**: Separation of powers between legislature, executive, and judiciary
- **Committee Systems**: Global practices of parliamentary committees across democracies

## 1. What - Definition, Classification & Types

**Definition**: Parliamentary committees are groups of members from both or either House of Parliament, appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker/Chairman, working under defined terms of reference to examine specific matters, conduct investigations, and report back to the Parliament.

**Classification**:

1. **Based on Function**:
    
    - **Deliberative Committees**: Examine bills, policies, and budgetary proposals
    - **Scrutiny Committees**: Oversee executive actions
    - **Investigative Committees**: Inquire into specific issues
    - **Service Committees**: Look after members' welfare and administrative matters
2. **Based on Membership**:
    
    - **Standing Committees**: Permanent and reconstituted periodically
    - **Ad-hoc Committees**: Temporary and dissolved after fulfilling their mandate
3. **Based on Composition**:
    
    - **House Committees**: Members from one House only
    - **Joint Committees**: Members from both Houses

**Types of Committees**:

4. **Standing Committees**:

    - **House Committees**: Business Advisory Committee, Rules Committee, General Purposes Committee
    - **Service Committees**: House Committee, Library Committee, Committee on Petitions
5. **Ad-hoc Committees**:
    
    - **Select Committees**: Examine specific bills (single House)
    - **Joint Committees**: Examine specific bills (both Houses)
    - **Inquiry Committees**: Investigate specific issues

## 19. Conclusion

Parliamentary committees represent the institutional evolution of India's parliamentary democracy, embodying the principle that detailed scrutiny enhances governance quality. They serve as specialized instruments of parliamentary oversight, combining political representation with technical expertise to navigate complex governance challenges.

The committee system has evolved from its modest post-independence beginnings to become a comprehensive network covering all aspects of governance. While challenges persist—particularly regarding enforcement powers, resource constraints, and occasional partisan behavior—committees have consistently demonstrated their value in enhancing legislation, strengthening oversight, and improving policy.

The future evolution of the committee system will likely involve greater digitalization, enhanced research support, more public engagement, and possibly constitutional recognition. Their continued effectiveness will depend on maintaining their non-partisan character, strengthening their powers, enhancing their research capabilities, and increasing public awareness of their work.

As India's governance challenges grow in complexity, the role of parliamentary committees as deliberative spaces for detailed examination, consensus-building, and accountability will remain crucial to the health of parliamentary democracy.
